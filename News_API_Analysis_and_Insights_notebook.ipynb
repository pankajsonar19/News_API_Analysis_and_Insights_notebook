    "## NEWS_API_Analysis_Insights_and_Quality_of_Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- The below notebook investigates the quality of the news content provided by the API in order to effectively support the use case as :\n",
    "\n",
    "    A customer looking to build a simple news reader application. The application will support three key functionalities\n",
    "         ● Browse news content and view the full text of individual articles\n",
    "     \n",
    "         ● Search the news for specific entities such as people, organisations and places\n",
    "         \n",
    "         ● Group related content together so that users do not see similar articles from multiple sources in their news stream or search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It also contains some insights using some visualizations and some other processing that can be used by the customer in their application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Approach to this use case is as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. The Aylien provides different API endpoints that can be useful to get the data to address the above functionalities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. I have found following two API's that can be used:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        i. 'http://api.core.live.gcp.aylien.com/api/v1/stories'\n",
    "                - The above endpoint returns a dictionary of stories and their contents and some important metadata. I am using this API endpoint to address my first two functionalities i.e For viewing the text content and searching the news using specific entities.\n",
    "        ii. 'http://api.core.live.gcp.aylien.com/api/v1/related_stories'\n",
    "                - This endpoint is used for finding semantically similar stories based on the parameters you provide as inputs. I am using this API endpoint to address my third functionality i.e to group related content together.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. My main aim is access the quality of the data which is returned after firing a query to this API's. So for that, I am trying to check the quality by considering some of the below ways:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        i.   The API returns loads of data, so my task is to get only the relevant data that will address the above functionalities.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ii.  Check if there is no missing data ?\n",
    "        \n",
    "        iii. Check if this data content is cleaned ? If not apply some pre-processing techniques.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        iv.  Try to visualize some insights from the data.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        v.   Explore some other data points that can be useful to check the quality.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        vi.  Try to dig more into a data and do some more processing that can be useful for the customer application.\n",
    "        \n",
